# R_Data_Analysis

My Topic is about Vehicle collisions/Car crashes
My Objectives for my project is the following:
1. figuring out what are the most common factors that lead to vehicle crashes
2. What are the most common type of vehicles the contribute to vehicle crashes
3. What are the deadliest vehicle crashes
4. What days of the week are vehicle crashes more common
5. What time of day are vehicle crashes more common


To fulfill these objectives, I made a shiny app using ggplot2, tidyr, and dplyr (by importing the tidyverse library) to answer those quesitons.
There will be four options to organize by:


1. The type of vehicle
2. factors organized in categories
3. Day of week
4. Hour of Day
Strategy: Visualize the data to fulfill each objective based on injury rate and death rate

Note: This includes a Shiny application and you do need to run the data_gather.R first to do the heavy lifting
